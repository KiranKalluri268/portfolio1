# Saikiran Kalluri — Portfolio

A responsive, animated software engineering portfolio built with Next.js, React, GSAP, Lenis, and Tailwind CSS. It presents Saikiran Kalluri's work, experience, technical skills, résumé, and contact information through a continuous vertical narrative with a pinned horizontal Projects section.

**Live site:** [saikirankalluri.vercel.app](https://saikirankalluri.vercel.app)

## Technology

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Framework | Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4, CSS Modules |
| Motion | GSAP, ScrollTrigger, Lenis |
| PDF | `@react-pdf/renderer` |
| Contact delivery | Resend REST API through a Next.js route handler |
| Icons | React Icons |
| Deployment | Vercel |
| Verification | ESLint, TypeScript through `next build`, GitHub Actions |

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- A Resend account if you want the contact form to deliver email

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiranKalluri268/portfolio1.git
cd portfolio1
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The portfolio can be viewed without valid Resend credentials, but contact submissions will return a configuration error until the required variables are supplied.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Yes for contact delivery | Resend API key used only by the server route |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | Yes for contact delivery | Destination for submitted messages |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | Optional | Verified sender; defaults to Resend's onboarding sender |

Never commit `.env.local` or expose `RESEND_API_KEY` through a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable. See [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for provider setup and limits.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the Turbopack development server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint across the repository
npm run build    # Type-check and create an optimized production build
npm run start    # Serve the completed production build
```

Recommended verification before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Application routes

| Route | Purpose |

| `/projects` | Placeholder for detailed project case studies; currently `noindex` |
| `/api/contact` | Server-side contact form endpoint |
| `/opengraph-image` | Generated 1200×630 social preview |
| `/robots.txt` | Search crawler rules |
| `/sitemap.xml` | Indexable route list |

## Accessibility and performance

The site uses native buttons and links, visible focus states, skip links, semantic sections, and `prefers-reduced-motion`. Background video and audio pause while the tab is hidden. Decorative canvas work is reduced or stopped when appropriate, and skill animation pauses outside the viewport.

Performance-sensitive changes should be tested on a real touch device as well as desktop Chrome DevTools. See [Animation system](docs/ANIMATIONS.md) before adding new scroll effects.

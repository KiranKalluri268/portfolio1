# Contributing

Contributions are welcome when they preserve the portfolio's accessibility, performance, and visual intent.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KiranKalluri268/portfolio1.git
cd portfolio1
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Contact delivery is optional during UI development. Never commit real API keys or recipient addresses.

## Before changing code

- Read [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for ownership boundaries.
- Read [Animation system](ANIMATIONS.md) before modifying scrolling or motion.
- Check [IMPROVEMENTS.md](../IMPROVEMENTS.md) for known work.
- Keep changes focused; avoid mixing visual redesigns with architecture refactors.

## Code expectations

- Use TypeScript and existing shared types.
- Use native semantic elements for interactive controls.
- Preserve keyboard and touch behavior.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Keep native scrolling available; do not add wheel hijacking.
- Do not create a second Lenis instance or a competing global scroll manager.
- Scope GSAP work and clean up every tween, trigger, observer, listener, and timer.
- Keep personal content in JSON where an established data source exists.
- Optimize large images, audio, and video before committing.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

For visual changes, manually verify:

- Desktop and mobile widths
- Short mobile landscape viewports
- Mouse wheel and trackpad scrolling
- Touch swipes in Projects
- Keyboard navigation and visible focus
- Reduced-motion mode
- Route navigation and restored scroll position
- Background-tab audio/video behavior

## Commit messages

Use concise Conventional Commit-style messages:

```text
feat(scope): add capability
fix(scope): correct behavior
refactor(scope): simplify implementation
docs: update project documentation
perf(scope): reduce rendering cost
```

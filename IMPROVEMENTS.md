# Portfolio Improvements Backlog

This document records the recommended improvements in priority order. The ordering is based on user impact, correctness, accessibility, and risk.

## Priority 0 — Critical fixes

### ~~1. Remove the audio gate from the entire portfolio~~ — Completed

**Problem:** The main portfolio is rendered only when `audioEnabled` is true. If a visitor does not enable audio, the actual site is hidden.

**Required change:** Always render the portfolio. Treat audio as an optional enhancement controlled by the audio toggle.

**Expected result:** The site remains usable without sound, autoplay permission, or interaction with the loading screen.

**Relevant areas:** `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/LoadingScreen.tsx`, `src/context/AudioContextProvider.tsx`.

### ~~2. Make the contact form functional or remove the success claim~~ — Completed

**Problem:** The contact form clears its fields and displays a success message without sending data anywhere.

**Required change:** Connect the form to a real API/email provider/server action, including loading, success, and failure states. If no backend is available, replace the form with a working `mailto:` or external contact link.

**Expected result:** Visitors can reliably contact the owner and receive truthful feedback.

**Relevant area:** `src/components/Contact.tsx`.

### ~~3. Restore keyboard focus visibility~~ — Completed

**Problem:** Global CSS removes all focus outlines and box shadows, making keyboard navigation inaccessible.

**Required change:** Delete the global focus removal rule. Add a consistent `:focus-visible` style with sufficient contrast and preserve component-specific focus rings.

**Expected result:** Keyboard users can see which control is active.

**Relevant area:** `src/app/globals.css`.

### ~~4. Add complete reduced-motion support~~ — Completed

**Problem:** The site continuously animates text, transitions, particles, canvases, and video without respecting motion preferences.

**Required change:** Detect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; disable or substantially simplify scene transitions, typing effects, particle movement, looping video, and decorative animations.

**Expected result:** The site is comfortable and safe for users sensitive to motion, while preserving the content and navigation.

**Relevant areas:** global CSS, `Hero`, `SceneWrapper`, background components, carousel components.

### ~~5. Make interactive controls semantic and keyboard usable~~ — Completed

**Problem:** Some controls use `div` elements with `role="button"`, synthetic keyboard events, or mouse-only behavior.

**Required change:** Use native `<button>` and `<a>` elements. Add Enter/Space behavior only where a custom control is unavoidable. Ensure every interactive element has an accessible name and usable focus state.

**Expected result:** Reliable keyboard, screen-reader, touch, and browser behavior.

**Relevant areas:** `src/components/hero.tsx`, navigation controls, scene indicators, tooltips, carousel controls.

## Priority 1 — Major usability and architecture improvements

### ~~6. Keep all important portfolio content in the semantic document~~ — Completed

**Problem:** Only the current scene is mounted. Search engines, assistive technology, browser find, text selection, and no-JavaScript users cannot reliably access all sections.

**Required change:** Render all major sections in the document with semantic headings and landmarks. Use animation and scene navigation as progressive enhancement, not as the only way to access content.

**Expected result:** Better SEO, accessibility, resilience, printing, deep linking, and content discoverability.

**Relevant areas:** `src/app/page.tsx`, scene components, navigation manager.

### ~~7. Simplify navigation state management~~ — Completed

**Problem:** Several contexts and global event listeners overlap: `UnifiedScrollManager`, `ScrollManager`, `ScrollManagerContext`, `GlobalContext`, and project view state.

**Required change:** Consolidate navigation into one state machine/reducer or one navigation context. Define clear responsibilities for scene state, carousel state, transition locking, and input handling.

**Expected result:** Fewer race conditions, easier debugging, and simpler future changes.

**Relevant areas:** `src/context/*`, `SceneWrapper`, `ProjectsSection`.

### ~~8. Protect form and text inputs from global keyboard shortcuts~~ — Completed

**Problem:** Global handling of Arrow keys, `W`, and `S` can interfere with typing, cursor movement, and scrolling inside form controls.

**Required change:** Ignore navigation shortcuts when the event target is an input, textarea, select, button, link, contenteditable element, or an element inside a dialog.

**Expected result:** Form fields and normal browser interaction work as expected.

**Relevant area:** `src/context/UnifiedScrollManager.tsx`.

### ~~9. Reduce background rendering cost~~ — Completed

**Problem:** Multiple full-screen canvas animation loops and a looping video run continuously, including when they are not necessary.

**Required change:** Pause loops when the tab is hidden, reduce frame rate and particle count on mobile, use static fallbacks, avoid redraws for static effects, and consider consolidating canvas layers.

**Expected result:** Better battery life, lower CPU/GPU usage, fewer dropped frames, and improved mobile performance.

**Relevant areas:** `StarfieldBackground`, `CometsInBackground`, `BlackholeEffect`, video background.

### ~~10. Fix linting and enforce quality checks~~ — Completed

**Problem:** `npm run lint` is broken because it calls the removed `next lint` command. Direct ESLint currently reports five unused-variable errors.

**Required change:** Update the script to invoke ESLint directly, align the ESLint configuration with the installed Next.js version, and fix all reported errors.

**Expected result:** Linting works locally and can be enforced in CI.

**Known errors:**

- Unused `definition` in `SceneWrapper.tsx`
- Unused `delayBetweenLines` in `hero.tsx`
- Unused `isForward` in `hero.tsx`
- Unused `TRANSITION_DURATION` in `UnifiedScrollManager.tsx`
- Unused `SCENE_DISPLAY_TIME` in `UnifiedScrollManager.tsx`

### ~~11. Align and audit dependencies~~ — Completed

**Problem:** `next` is version 16 while `eslint-config-next` is version 15. Some dependencies may be unused or accidental (`lib`, `util`, and potentially others).

**Required change:** Align Next.js-related package versions, remove unused dependencies, run a clean install, and verify the lockfile.

**Expected result:** More predictable builds, fewer compatibility problems, and a smaller dependency surface.

**Relevant area:** `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

### ~~12. Fix deployment configuration~~ — Completed

**Problem:** The GitHub Pages workflow uploads `./out`, but Next.js is not configured with static export output. SEO URLs also point to Vercel.

**Required change:** Choose one deployment target. For GitHub Pages, configure static export and verify asset/base-path behavior. For Vercel, remove or replace the Pages workflow.

**Expected result:** Deployment is deterministic and matches the declared canonical domain.

**Relevant areas:** `next.config.ts`, `.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`, metadata, sitemap, robots.

## Priority 2 — SEO, content, and hiring effectiveness

### ~~13. Improve metadata and social sharing~~ — Completed

Add `metadataBase`, canonical URL, Open Graph metadata, Twitter card metadata, and a properly designed social preview image. Shorten and clarify the page title.

Also change JSON-LD from `http://schema.org` to `https://schema.org`.

**Relevant areas:** `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts`, `public/images`.

### ~~14. Fix heading hierarchy and semantic landmarks~~ — Completed

Use one page-level `<h1>`. Change the navbar logo heading to a non-heading element if appropriate. Ensure every section has a visible heading, and use `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, and `footer` consistently.

### 15. Improve project information and links

Give every project its own repository link where available, add live demos where available, and explain:

- The problem solved
- The owner's contribution
- Key technical decisions
- Measurable result or impact
- Main lessons learned

Avoid linking projects only to the general GitHub profile.

### 16. Add a clear résumé and hiring call to action

Add a downloadable résumé, current availability, preferred role, location/time zone, and one prominent contact action. Keep social links as secondary actions.

### 17. Correct copy and encoding issues

Fix grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and corrupted characters such as `Â©` and `â†’`.

Examples include:

- “AI Enthusiastic” → “AI enthusiast”
- “a AI-powered” → “an AI-powered”
- Add spacing around separators in the title
- Use consistent technology naming: Node.js, GitHub, Java, AWS, etc.

### 18. Replace invalid machine-readable dates

Use valid `dateTime` values such as `2026-01` or separate start/end dates instead of strings like `January 2026 - Present` in the `dateTime` attribute.

## Priority 3 — Maintainability and polish

### ~~19. Remove duplicate font loading~~ — Completed

Fonts are loaded using both `next/font/google` and a Google Fonts CSS import. Keep the Next.js font integration and remove the duplicate import.

### ~~20. Replace the default README~~ — Completed

Document the actual project, including:

- Purpose and feature overview
- Local setup
- Environment variables
- Available scripts
- Deployment instructions
- Contact form configuration
- Accessibility and reduced-motion behavior

### 21. Add automated tests and CI checks

At minimum, test:

- Scene navigation boundaries
- Carousel boundaries
- Contact form validation and submission states
- Keyboard navigation
- Audio-disabled rendering

CI should run type-checking, ESLint, production build, and accessibility/performance checks where practical.

### ~~22. Remove unused code and legacy context paths~~ — Completed (`SpaceBackground.tsx` intentionally retained)

After navigation consolidation, remove unused contexts, commented-out audio code, unused constants, unused props, and stale implementation notes.

### ~~23. Improve mobile layout and touch discoverability~~ — Completed (real-device QA recommended)

Test small phones, landscape orientation, browser zoom, reduced viewport heights, and touch scrolling. Avoid relying only on “scroll down” text and hidden scene controls.

### 24. Add observability for real-world failures

Add error reporting or at least structured client-side logging for failed form submissions, media load failures, and navigation exceptions. Do not expose sensitive user data in logs.
